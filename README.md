## 🏗️ Building the Project

### Using Visual Studio

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logesh11exe/BlockCopier.git
cd FileBackup
```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
```bash
FileBackup.sln
```

3. Configure the build:
   - Select "Release" configuration
   - Select "x64" platform for x64 build and "x86" for x86 Build
   - Ensure Windows SDK version matches your system

4. Build the solution:
   - Press F7 or select Build > Build Solution
   - Alternatively, use the command line:
	 - For x64
     ```bash
     msbuild FileBackup.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
     ```
	 - For x86
     ```bash
     msbuild FileBackup.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x86
     ```

## 📥 Installation

1. Build the project using the method above

2. The executable will be located at:
  - For x64 Build
   ```
   x64/Release/FileBackup.exe
   ```
   
  - For x86 Build
   ```
   Release/FileBackup.exe
   ```

3. Copy the executable to your desired location

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. 📸 SnapShot to Empty Removable Drive Copy Test:
```bash
FileBackup.exe \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy8 \\.\F: 20 2
```
> **Note:** 
> - You should provide the path of an existing snapshot as the first parameter
> - Should provide the logical drive letter path to an External Removable Drive as second parameter
> - Number of threads as third parameter
> - Block size in MB as fourth parameter

2. 💽 Snapshot to Empty HardDisk:
```bash
FileBackup.exe \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy8 \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1 20 2
```
> **Note:** The only change here is to provide the DeviceObject's path as the destination path for a hard disk (since it's a block copy to a raw harddrive)

3. ⚙️ Default Parameters:
```bash
FileBackup.exe \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy8 \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1 --usedefault
```
> **Note:** Here `--usedefault` param uses 4 threads and 1MB as default values and proceeds to copy.

### Validation Steps

1. ✅ File Integrity Check:
   - Compare source and destination file sizes
   
   **Verify File Integrity (Size Comparison)**
   This is the quickest initial check. If sizes don't match, the content definitely won't.

   ```bash
   # Get Source File Size
   dir "E:\"
   # Note: Before taking the snapshot you might have known the exact source path. 
   # Kindly provide that exact path here

   # Get Destination File Size
   dir "F:\"
   # Note: After copying it to a disk. Provide that path as the path.
   ```

   **Expected Result:** The byte counts for both files should be identical.
   > ⚠️ If sizes differ: The copy operation failed to create an exact duplicate. The file integrity check has failed.

2. 📊 Performance Validation:
   - Monitor CPU usage (should be balanced across threads)
   - Check memory usage (should be stable)
   - Verify I/O throughput

3. 🚨 Error Handling Test:
   - Test with non-existent source
   - Test with insufficient permissions
